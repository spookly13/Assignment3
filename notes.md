# Notes

1. Date of Birth needs to be trimmed down to a basic string i.e. 10/11/1959
2. How to enter additional respondents??  
3. Simpler if the gender selection is done via a drop-down? That will mean we only need to filter on the 'gender' 
4. line 106 - div id+"names" is incorrect. should be gender
5. need a loop for the data input, currently only accepting a singel entry - SENTINEL loop???
